            <p>"WANDER IN VIETNAM" is my travel video in Vietnam. I tried to focus on the people and their life. I found that they have a interesting culture and scenery. Hope that this video shows various images of Vietnam from my eyes.</p>

            <p>When travelling around Tokyo, I met a Kabuki master; Kabuki is the Opera equivalent in Japan. It's an art that is slowly disappearing in the modern world of Tokyo. I was so taken back by the master's passion and dedication to the art. The traditions, the preparation, the slow movements or the performance and the hallowing chants that echo through your body as the story unravels — everything about it was so sacred and considered. I wanted to mirror each of these characteristics in the edit, with both the motion and sound design. To capture an art that will inevitably be forgotten in the coming years.</p>

            <p>Ceylon - A journey through Sri Lanka. After a tough year, my girlfriend and I took a time out from the world. We made a quite adventurous but wonderful journey through Ceylon. Came back with over 100 GB footage though. Well, so I just had to make a short film. Enjoy! Thanks to our friends Still Parade from Berlin!</p>
